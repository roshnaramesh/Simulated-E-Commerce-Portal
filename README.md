# Simulated-E-Commerce-Portal
The Simulated-E-Commerce-Portal is similar to an inventory management system that was developed as part of the course "Engineering Distributed Objects for cloud computing".It invloves communication between the distributed objects-Customer,Retailer,Supplier and Warehouse.It was developed to provide the customers their desired product by identifying the nearest retailer who has that product in stock. It also maintains that the warehouse supplies the products to the retail stores on demand and the supplier ships the requested products to the warehouse. The software can be used to maintain data for a large multinational retail corporation. It uses the Google Maps API to identify the locality of the retail stores and warehouses. The retail store managers, warehouse administrators and the suppliers can log into the system and keep track of the products and stock. The data is maintained in large databases.

The customer will not have any login id. They will use the console to specify the products details. The system does not incorporate the credit card processing services. It also does not allow the users of the system to view and edit their profiles.
